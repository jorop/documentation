# Signing up

To sign up for the Cloudomation platform, navigate to the <i class="fa fa-fw fa-user-plus"></i> Sign Up button in the left hand pane menu. You will be directed to the sign up form. To create your Cloudomation account, you need to fill in the following details:

**Client name**  
The client name can be any name that you choose. It is the top level name of your Cloudomation account. There can be several users under the same client name in Cloudomation. Users within the same client share resources: they use the same token that are assigned to one client, and they can see and edit each other's flow scripts, settings, and executions.  
In a professional setting, the client name would be your company's, association's, school's or organisation's name. Note that there is no requirement from Cloudomation's side that the client name must be real or representative of your organisation - you can choose any name you like.  
You and all other users in your client will need the client name to sign in.  
Note that it is not possible to change the client name after sign up.

**User name**  
The user name can be any name you choose. This is the name associated with your particular user. The user created at the time of sign-up will automatically be assigned the role of client administrator for the client created during the setup process. As such, this user will be able to create additional users for the client afterwards. Review the [user roles](/User+roles.md) to learn more about the different user roles available on the Cloudomation platform.  
The user name does not have to be a real name, or be representative of you or your real name, you can choose any user name you like.  
You will need your user name to log in. The user name will be used to log your activities within the Cloudomation platform (for you, we cannot see these logs). For example: when you start a flow script, the resulting execution will list your user name as the user who started the execution.  
Note that it is not possible to change your user name after sign up.

**Email address**  
The email address you provide will be the email address on record for contacting you about your Cloudomation account. Note that the email address you provide at sign up will be the email address associated with the client and will be used for communication about all matters related to the Cloudomation client, and not just your user. You can change the email address after sign up.  
Once you complete the sign up form and press "Sign up", you will receive a confirmation email to the email address you provided. You need to activate your account with this confirmation email, otherwise you are not able to complete the sign up process.  

**Password**  
Choose any password. You can change the password after the sign up at any time.  

**Password again**  
Repeat the password.  

**Invitation code**  
As Cloudomation is currently only available in Beta release, you need an invitation code to create an account. Get in touch at info@cloudomation.com if you are interested about receiving an invitation code.  

**Logging in after sign up**
Once you have completed the sign up process, you can log in to the Cloudomation platform. If you choose the "remember me" option at login, a login cookie will be set for your account which will automatically log you in whenever you visit the Cloudomation page with the same browser. The login cookie is valid for 90 days.  
Note that if you change your password, it can happen that the cookie becomes invalid. Log out and log back in again to resolve any issues.
