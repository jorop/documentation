# Examples

Here, we collect examples of well-commented flow scripts that might help you get started with writing your own. All examples are also available in the [public flow script library](https://github.com/starflows/library){ext}.

If you are not looking for code, but for example use cases, please take a look at these [example use cases](/site/Example+use+cases).
