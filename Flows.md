# Flows

The Flows section shows all flow scripts that you currently have available on the Cloudomation platform. Here, you can manually [create new flow scripts](#createflowscripts), [run flow scripts](#runflowscripts), [edit existing flow scripts](#editflowscripts) and [delete flow scripts](#deleteflowscripts).

## Create flow scripts
Once you press the "new" button on the top left of the Flows section view, a flow script editor will be opened. The editor will already contain a few sample code lines. Replace the "# TODO: write your automation" line with your automation. Clicking the run button on top of the flow view will execute the flow and automatically redirect you to the [Executions](Executions) view.  

A newly created flow will automatically be assigned an ID and a name. The ID is a sequential number that uniquely identifies the flow which can not be edited. The name is new flow plus a time stamp. You can edit the name of a flow either in the flow details view or in the flows overview.  

The flow script editor provided in the Cloudomation user interface is mainly intended for writing small flow scripts, or doing small edits on existing flow scripts. For larger projects, it is recommended to use an editor of your choice and synchronise your flow scripts to the Cloudomation platform via git (or any other remotely accessible store which you can access via a flow script), or to use the [helper script](/Running+flow+scripts+remotely) to run your local flow scripts remotely.
