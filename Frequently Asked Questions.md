# Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is Cloudomation?
Cloudomation is a software automation platform. With Cloudomation, you can control, schedule, and communicate with other software. This allows you to define routines that are executed without human oversight or interaction – fully automatically.

#### What can I automate with Cloudomation?
You can automate the interaction of software components that have an application programming interface (API) or allow some other kind of remote access. Cloudomation can monitor the state of a system, it lets you react to changes in a system, read data from a system, process your business logic to transform data or make decisions, write data to a system, or execute scripts on systems.

#### How do I use Cloudomation?
Automation workflows are defined in Flow Scripts. Flow Scripts are written in Python, using normal Python syntax plus Cloudomation specific functions.

#### What is the difference between a normal Python script and a Cloudomation script?
Cloudomation scripts are transaction safe and scalable. With Cloudomation, you can easily schedule and monitor script execution. It allows detailed introspection through logging of all inputs and outputs, which creates a consistent audit trail and simplifies debugging. Through the simple input and output definitions available in Cloudomation, you can manage large and complex automation workflows easily.

#### Do I need to know Python to use Cloudomation?
No. Some programming experience is recommended, and knowing Python is an advantage, but it is not necessary. Cloudomation provides documentation of its functions and examples of common routines. If you have experience with any programming language, you will be able to put together a Flow Script without knowing Python.

#### Is Cloudomation a Python module?
No, though it a good metaphor. Cloudomation functionality is exposed through a native Python API. This means that you write Cloudomation functions in Python syntax, but it is executed in a different way than “normal” Python code.

#### Can I run normal Python code on the Cloudomation platform?
Yes, but you are limited in what you can do. You cannot install modules and you can only use a limited amount of resources on the platform. You also do not have local storage space available. Cloudomation is not intended as a Python IDE. You can execute complex Python scripts on other systems through Cloudomation. You can use Cloudomation to deyploy and environment where you can run your Python scripts, or use Cloudomation to execute scripts on already existing environments.

#### Do I have to install Cloudomation to use it?
No, Cloudomation is a cloud platform. Just go to cloudomation.com to create your account and try it out for up to six weeks for free.
